Objective #
The primary objective of this assignment is to build a streaming client-server application that employs Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) for securing key frames. Students are required to implement the client and server, stream media between them, identify key frames to be encrypted, and perform encryption and decryption using ABE. Additionally, the quality of experience (QoE) must be quantified through metrics such as jitter and delay.</description></item></channel></rss>
